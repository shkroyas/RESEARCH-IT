    "summary": "  Individual-machine, superimposed-machine and equivalent-machine can be seen\nas the three major perspectives of the power system transient stability. In\nthis paper, the machine paradigms are established according to the common\nthinking among the three different machines. The machine paradigms comprise of\nthe three components, i.e., trajectory paradigm, modeling paradigm and energy\nparadigm. The trajectory paradigm is the reflection of the trajectory\nstability; the modeling paradigm is the two-machine-system modeling of the\ntrajectory stability; and the energy paradigm is the stability evaluation of\nthe two-machine system. Based on this, it is clarified that the machine\nparadigms can be expressed into the individual machine form or the equivalent\nmachine form. Then, the relationship between the machine stability and the\nsystem stability are analyzed. Simulation results show that the effectiveness\nof both the individual-machine and the equivalent machine is fully based on the\nstrict followings of the machine paradigms.\n",
