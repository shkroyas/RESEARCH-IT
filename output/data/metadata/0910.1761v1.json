    "summary": "  This paper will provide a method to decompose forging dies for machining\nplanning in the case of high speed machining finishing operations. This method\nlies on a machining feature approach model presented in the following paper.\nThe two main decomposition phases, called Basic Machining Features Extraction\nand Process Planning Generation, are presented. These two decomposition phases\nintegrates machining resources models and expert machining knowledge to provide\nan outstanding process planning.\n",
