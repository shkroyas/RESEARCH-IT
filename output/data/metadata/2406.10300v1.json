    "summary": "  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely adopted recently. Research\nexplores their use both as autonomous agents and as tools for software\nengineering. LLM-integrated applications, on the other hand, are software\nsystems that leverage an LLM to perform tasks that would otherwise be\nimpossible or require significant coding effort. While LLM-integrated\napplication engineering is emerging as new discipline, its terminology,\nconcepts and methods need to be established. This study provides a taxonomy for\nLLM-integrated applications, offering a framework for analyzing and describing\nthese systems. It also demonstrates various ways to utilize LLMs in\napplications, as well as options for implementing such integrations.\n  Following established methods, we analyze a sample of recent LLM-integrated\napplications to identify relevant dimensions. We evaluate the taxonomy by\napplying it to additional cases. This review shows that applications integrate\nLLMs in numerous ways for various purposes. Frequently, they comprise multiple\nLLM integrations, which we term ``LLM components''. To gain a clear\nunderstanding of an application's architecture, we examine each LLM component\nseparately. We identify thirteen dimensions along which to characterize an LLM\ncomponent, including the LLM skills leveraged, the format of the output, and\nmore. LLM-integrated applications are described as combinations of their LLM\ncomponents. We suggest a concise representation using feature vectors for\nvisualization.\n  The taxonomy is effective for describing LLM-integrated applications. It can\ncontribute to theory building in the nascent field of LLM-integrated\napplication engineering and aid in developing such systems. Researchers and\npractitioners explore numerous creative ways to leverage LLMs in applications.\nThough challenges persist, integrating LLMs may revolutionize the way software\nsystems are built.\n",
