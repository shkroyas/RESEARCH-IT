    "summary": "  This paper focuses on the transformations from the individual machine to the\nequivalent machine through the \"correction\" perspective of the inner-group\nmachine. The machines are first classified as the real machine with equation of\nmotion and the pseudo machine without equation of motion. Then, it is clarified\nthat both individual machine and equivalent machine are real machines, while\nthe superimposed machine is a pseudo machine. Based on the classifications of\nthe machines, two types of machine transformations are provided. The two types\nof machine transformations are based on the \"energy correction\" and \"trajectory\ncorrection\" of the inner-group machine, respectively. For the energy correction\ncase, it is clarified that the trajectory transformation completely fails,\nwhile the energy transformation mathematically holds yet it is physically\nmeaningless. For the trajectory correction case, it is clarified that both\nenergy transformation and trajectory transformation are established. The reason\nis that each trajectory-correction based individual machine has the same\nequation of motion, i.e., the motion of the equivalent Machine-CR. Simulation\nresults show that the machine transformation from the individual machine to the\nequivalent machine can be realized only through trajectory correction.\n",
