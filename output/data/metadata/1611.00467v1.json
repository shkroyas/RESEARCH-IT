    "summary": "  Virtual machines have been widely adapted for high-level programming language\nimplementations and for providing a degree of platform neutrality. As the\noverall use and adaptation of virtual machines grow, the overall performance of\nvirtual machines has become a widely-discussed topic. In this paper, we present\na survey on the performance differences of the two most widely adapted types of\nvirtual machines - the stack-based virtual machine and the register-based\nvirtual machine - using various benchmark programs. Additionally, we adopted a\nnew approach of measuring performance by measuring the overall dispatch time,\namount of dispatches, fetch time, and execution time while running benchmarks\non custom-implemented, lightweight virtual machines. Finally, we present two\nlightweight, custom-designed, Turing-equivalent virtual machines that are\nspecifically designed in benchmarking virtual machine performance - the\n\"Conceptum\" stack-based virtual machine, and the \"Inertia\" register-based\nvirtual machine. Our result showed that while on average the register machine\nspends 20.39% less time in executing benchmarks than the stack machine, the\nstack-based virtual machine is still faster than the virtual machine regarding\nthe instruction fetch time.\n",
