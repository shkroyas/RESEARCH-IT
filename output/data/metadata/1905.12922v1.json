    "summary": "  Software metrics offer a quantitative basis for predicting the software\ndevelopment process. In this way, software quality can be improved very easily.\nSoftware quality should be achieved to satisfy the customer with decreasing the\nsoftware cost and improve there liability of the software product. In this\nresearch, we have discussed how the software metrics affect the quality of the\nsoftware and which stages of its development software metrics have applied. We\ndiscussed the different software metrics and how these metrics have an impact\non software quality and reliability. These techniques have been used for\nimproving the quality of software and increase the revenue.\n",
