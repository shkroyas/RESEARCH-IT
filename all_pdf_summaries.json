        "overview": "## Overview: Construction of Unbiased Dental Template and Parametric Dental Model for Precision Digital Dentistry\n\nThis paper presents a novel method for constructing an unbiased dental template and accurate parametric dental models for applications in digital dentistry.  The existing challenges in creating such models stem from the complex anatomical structures of the maxilla and mandible, and the low volume ratio of teeth within CBCT images.  Previous attempts relied on biased templates (e.g., single-subject templates, artificial templates), leading to inaccuracies in downstream applications. This research directly addresses these limitations by leveraging a statistically robust approach based on a large dataset of CBCT images and advanced image processing techniques.\n\n**The core contribution** is a two-stage process:  first, constructing an unbiased dental template through the creation of a dental atlas from a large cohort of CBCT scans; second, utilizing this unbiased template to build accurate parametric dental models representing shape and positional variations across a population.\n\n**The methodological approach** involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**  The study utilizes 159 CBCT images from Chinese subjects (aged 18-60) acquired using a Planmeca scanner.  Subjects with severe malocclusion or missing more than two teeth (excluding third molars) were excluded.  Images underwent standardization to a resolution of 0.4mm isotropic voxels and intensity normalization to the [0,1] range.\n\n2. **Teeth Segmentation and Labeling:** A deep learning-based U-Net architecture, combined with a hierarchical morphology-guided network, is employed for fully automatic teeth segmentation.  A hierarchical labeling strategy, combining manual labeling of a subset (30 subjects) with atlas-based labeling of the remainder, ensures accurate tooth identification.  This segmentation is crucial for guiding subsequent image enhancement and registration.\n\n3. **Segmentation-Guided Image Enhancement:**  To improve the accuracy of atlas construction, a three-part image enhancement strategy is implemented:\n    * **Image Cropping:**  Reduces background noise by cropping images to a margin of 30 voxels around the segmented teeth.\n    * **Image Masking:**  Removes surrounding tissue by using dilated binary segmentation masks to mask the cropped CBCT images, preventing interference from adjacent anatomical structures.\n    * **Intensity Reassignment:**  Enhances contrast between adjacent teeth in the segmentation images by reassigning intensity values based on tooth labels (Figure 2 illustrates this process, assigning unique intensity values to each tooth).  This step significantly improves the accuracy of subsequent registration.\n\n4. **Atlas Construction:**  The enhanced CBCT and segmentation images are jointly used to construct a dental atlas using the Symmetric Group-wise Normalization (SyGN) algorithm within the ANTs toolkit.  SyGN performs iterative multi-channel registration, averaging, and optimization to generate unbiased CBCT and segmentation image atlases.  The SyN algorithm within SyGN performs rigid, affine, and non-rigid diffeomorphic registrations using cross-correlation as the similarity metric. Specific parameter settings for the SyN algorithm (shrinkage, smoothing, and iterations) are detailed in the paper.  Finally, teeth are manually segmented from the CBCT atlas to create the unbiased dental template.\n\n5. **Parametric Model Construction:**  The unbiased dental template is used as a foundation for constructing parametric models:\n    * **Parametric Dentition Model:** This model captures the pose and shape variations of all teeth (upper and lower). Dental models are reconstructed from segmentation images, rigidly aligned to the template, and then non-rigidly registered to the template using the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm to establish point-to-point correspondences. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) then defines the shape variation subspaces of the parametric model.\n    * **Parametric Tooth Models:** Individual parametric models are created for each tooth type (incisors, canines, premolars, molars).  Similar to the dentition model, rigid registration to the template is followed by CPD for point-to-point correspondence estimation and PCA for subspace definition.\n\n**The results** demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in creating an unbiased dental template and accurate parametric dental models.  The generated template and models are publicly available on GitHub.  The paper concludes with a discussion of the significance of this work for advancing digital dentistry applications.  The method significantly improves the accuracy of dental image processing and analysis, particularly in applications relying on accurate spatial normalization and correspondence estimation.\n",
        "key_findings": "## Extremely Detailed Key Findings: Construction of Unbiased Dental Template and Parametric Dental Model for Precision Digital Dentistry\n\nThis study successfully constructed an unbiased dental template and corresponding parametric dental models using a novel approach leveraging 159 CBCT images from Chinese subjects aged 18-60.  The key findings are detailed below, categorized for clarity:\n\n\n**I. Unbiased Dental Template Construction:**\n\n* **Addressing Existing Limitations:** The research directly addresses the challenge of creating unbiased dental templates, acknowledging the limitations of previous methods that relied on biased templates (artificial, single-subject) leading to inaccuracies.  Specifically, the complex anatomical structures of the maxilla and mandible, coupled with the low volume ratio of teeth in CBCT images, were identified as major hurdles.\n\n* **Novel Image Enhancement Pipeline:**  A three-step image enhancement pipeline significantly improved atlas construction accuracy:\n    * **Cropping:** Removed background noise by cropping images to a 30-voxel margin around segmented teeth.  This focused processing on the region of interest, reducing interference from irrelevant anatomical structures.\n    * **Masking:** Eliminated surrounding tissues using dilated binary masks derived from teeth segmentation.  Dilation prevented masking of inaccurately segmented teeth boundaries.\n    * **Intensity Reassignment:** Enhanced contrast between adjacent teeth in segmentation images by reassigning intensity values based on tooth labels (Figure 2). This facilitated more accurate co-registration by improving the distinctiveness of individual teeth.  A hierarchical labeling method, initially trained on 30 manually labeled subjects, and then applied to the remaining subjects via atlas-based labeling, ensured consistent tooth identification across the dataset.\n\n* **SyGN-based Atlas Construction:** The study employed the SyGN (Symmetric Group-wise Normalization) algorithm within the ANTs toolkit for atlas construction. This iterative approach performed multi-channel registration between enhanced CBCT and segmentation images, resulting in a high-accuracy CBCT image atlas and segmentation image atlas. Specific parameters for SyN (symmetric normalization) within SyGN were detailed: shrinkage factors (8 ×4×2×1), smoothing factors (3×2×1×0), and maximum iterations (100×80×40×10). Cross-correlation was used as the similarity metric for image registration.\n\n* **Unbiased Template Generation:** Manual segmentation of teeth from the generated CBCT image atlas yielded the final unbiased dental template. This template serves as a population-average representation of dental structures, free from individual subject biases. The resulting template and parametric models are publicly available at https://github.com/Marvin0724/Teeth_template.\n\n**II. Parametric Dental Model Construction:**\n\n* **Leveraging the Unbiased Template:** The unbiased dental template was crucial for constructing accurate parametric models.  This contrasts with previous methods hampered by biased templates.\n\n* **Point-to-Point Correspondence Estimation:**  Dental models were reconstructed from segmentation images and rigidly aligned to the unbiased template.  Subsequently, non-rigid registration (using the Coherent Point Drift algorithm) established precise point-to-point correspondences between teeth across different subjects for the dentition model.  For individual tooth models, rigid registration followed by point-to-point correspondence estimation was performed.\n\n* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** PCA was applied to the aligned, corresponding point clouds to determine the shape variation modes for both the dentition model (capturing variations across all teeth) and individual tooth models.  This resulted in subspaces representing the typical shape variations within the population.\n\n**III. Dataset and Methodology:**\n\n* **Dataset Characteristics:** The study utilized 159 CBCT images (Planmeca scanner) from a Chinese population, excluding subjects with severe malocclusion or missing two or more teeth (excluding third molars).  Age range was 18-60.  CBCT image resolutions were standardized to 0.4mm isotropic resolution after initial resolution variation (0.1mm to 0.4mm).\n\n\n**IV. Overall Significance:**\n\n* **Novelty:** This is the first study to present a method for constructing an unbiased dental template, significantly advancing the field of digital dentistry.\n\n* **Improved Accuracy:** The proposed method, incorporating image enhancement and SyGN-based atlas construction, significantly improved the accuracy of both template and parametric model generation compared to previously used biased methods.\n\n* **Broad Applicability:** The generated unbiased dental template and parametric dental models have wide-ranging applications in digital dentistry, including improved teeth segmentation, dental mesh repairing, 3D teeth reconstruction, dental implant planning, and orthodontic treatment planning, and potentially boosting the performance of deep learning models in dental applications.\n\n* **Public Availability:**  The accessibility of the generated template and models fosters collaboration and further research within the community.\n\n\nThe study’s detailed methodology, including specific parameter choices and algorithmic steps, ensures reproducibility and facilitates further development and refinement of unbiased dental models. The successful creation of the unbiased template and parametric models represents a substantial advancement in the accuracy and efficiency of digital dentistry applications.\n",
        "methodologies": "## 2. Materials and Methods\n\nThis section details the methodologies employed in constructing an unbiased dental template and parametric dental models.  The process involves several key stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, dental atlas construction (including teeth segmentation, image enhancement, and atlas generation), and finally, the construction of parametric dental models (both dentition and individual tooth models).\n\n### 2.1. Dataset Acquisition and Preprocessing\n\n**2.1.1 Data Acquisition:** A total of 159 cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were selected from a digital archive at the First People’s Hospital of Hangzhou.  The images were acquired using a Planmeca dental CBCT scanner.  \n\n**Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:** Subjects with severe malocclusion (defined as [Specify a precise clinical definition of \"severe malocclusion\" used for exclusion, e.g., Angle's classification > Class III]) or missing two or more teeth (excluding third molars) were excluded.  The age range of included subjects was 18–60 years, all of Chinese ethnicity.\n\n**Image Characteristics:** The original CBCT images had varying resolutions (0.1–0.4 mm voxel size) with consistent x and y dimensions of 400 pixels, and z dimensions ranging from 256–328 pixels.\n\n**2.1.2 Preprocessing:** Before atlas construction, all CBCT images underwent standardization and normalization:\n\n1. **Resolution Standardization:**  All images were resampled to a uniform resolution of 0.4 mm × 0.4 mm × 0.4 mm using [Specify interpolation method, e.g., trilinear interpolation] to ensure consistent voxel size across the dataset.  [Specify software used for resampling, e.g.,  ANTs, ITK-SNAP].\n\n2. **Intensity Normalization:**  Voxel intensities were normalized to the range [0, 1] using [Specify normalization method, e.g., min-max normalization].  This step ensures that intensity variations due to scanner settings or acquisition parameters do not affect the subsequent image processing steps.  The normalization formula used was:  `I_normalized = (I - I_min) / (I_max - I_min)`, where `I` represents the original intensity, `I_min` the minimum intensity across all images, and `I_max` the maximum intensity.\n\n### 2.2. Dental Atlas Construction\n\nThe dental atlas was constructed using a multi-step process (Figure 1).  The process is detailed below:\n\n**2.2.1 Teeth Segmentation and Labeling:**\n\n1. **Segmentation Method:** A fully automated deep learning-based tooth segmentation method [20] (cite the reference completely) was employed.  This method comprised two key stages:\n    *   **Teeth Region Extraction:** An U-Net architecture [Cite U-Net Paper] was used to identify and segment the overall teeth region from the CBCT images.  [Specify details of the U-Net architecture used – e.g., number of layers, filters, etc., training data size, and validation metrics].\n    *   **Individual Tooth Segmentation:** A hierarchical morphology-guided network [Specify network architecture details, including the method used for morphological guidance] was subsequently applied to separate and segment individual teeth within the extracted teeth region.  [Specify hyperparameters used in the training, for example, learning rate, optimizer, loss function].\n\n2. **Tooth Labeling:** A hierarchical labeling approach was implemented:\n    *   **Manual Labeling (Training Set):**  Thirty randomly selected subjects' segmented teeth were manually labeled by experienced clinicians [Specify the number of clinicians, their qualifications, and inter-rater reliability assessment].\n    *   **Atlas-Based Labeling (Remaining Subjects):** An initial dental atlas of teeth segmentation images was created from the manually labeled data.  Atlas-based labeling [Cite the reference for atlas-based labeling technique] was then applied to the remaining subjects' segmentation images.  Non-rigid registration [Specify the registration algorithm used, e.g., SyN, Demons] was used to align the initial atlas to each subject's segmentation image, transferring the labels from the atlas to the individual images.\n    *   **Manual Quality Control:** A final manual quality check and correction of any mislabeled teeth was performed to ensure accuracy.  [Specify criteria for manual correction and the inter-rater reliability between manual labelers].\n\n\n**2.2.2 Segmentation-Guided Image Enhancement:**  To improve the accuracy of atlas construction, the CBCT and segmentation images were enhanced using a three-step process:\n\n1. **Image Cropping:** Both CBCT and segmentation images were cropped to a region of interest (ROI) encompassing the segmented teeth with a 30-voxel margin in each direction (x, y, z). This removed irrelevant background tissue.\n\n2. **Image Masking:** The dilated binary segmentation masks (dilation size: [Specify the size of the structuring element used for dilation]) were applied to the cropped CBCT images, effectively masking out the surrounding tissues and focusing only on the teeth region.\n\n3. **Intensity Reassignment:** The intensity values within the segmentation images were reassigned based on the individual tooth labels (Figure 2).  Each tooth was assigned a unique intensity value (Figure 2(b) shows the assignment scheme) to increase the contrast between adjacent teeth. This improved the registration accuracy by facilitating identification of corresponding teeth in different subjects. [Specify the range of intensity values assigned to each tooth label and how intensity values were chosen, if based on a predefined scale].\n\n\n**2.2.3 Atlas Construction using SyGN:**\n\nThe enhanced CBCT and segmentation images were used to jointly construct the dental atlases employing the Symmetric Group-wise Normalization (SyGN) algorithm [21] within the ANTs toolkit [Cite ANTs software].  SyGN performs iterative multi-channel registration, averaging, and optimization:\n\n1. **Initial Template Generation:** Initial templates were created by averaging all the enhanced CBCT and segmentation images separately.\n\n2. **Iterative Registration:**  Each pair of enhanced CBCT and segmentation images was registered to its corresponding initial template using the Symmetric Normalization (SyN) algorithm [23]. SyN involves rigid, affine, and diffeomorphic non-rigid registration steps. [Specify the specific parameters used in SyN algorithm, e.g.  metric, interpolation method]. The cross-correlation metric was used as the similarity measure for image registration.\n\n3. **Template Averaging and Optimization:**  The warped images from step (2) were averaged to create updated templates.  The affine transformations and deformation fields were also averaged and applied to the updated templates to refine their accuracy.\n\n4. **Iteration:** Steps (2) and (3) were iterated until convergence was achieved or a predefined maximum number of iterations was reached. The parameters used for SyN were: shrinkage factors (8 × 4 × 2 × 1), smoothing factors (3 × 2 × 1 × 0), and maximum iterations (100 × 80 × 40 × 10). [Explain the meaning of these parameters in the context of the SyN algorithm].\n\n5. **Unbiased Dental Template Generation:** Finally, teeth were manually segmented from the resulting CBCT image atlas, and 3D tooth mesh models were reconstructed from the segmentation to obtain the unbiased dental template.  [Specify the software used for mesh reconstruction].\n\n\n\n### 2.3. Parametric Dental Model Construction\n\nParametric models were constructed for both the entire dentition and individual teeth, leveraging the unbiased dental template:\n\n1. **Dental Model Reconstruction:**  3D dental models were reconstructed from the segmented teeth regions in each subject’s preprocessed CBCT images. [Specify the software and method used for 3D model reconstruction].\n\n2. **Rigid Alignment to Template:** Each reconstructed dental model was rigidly aligned to the unbiased dental template using [Specify rigid registration algorithm, e.g., Iterative Closest Point (ICP)].\n\n3. **Point-wise Correspondence Estimation (Dentition):** Non-rigid registration using the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm [24] was applied to establish point-wise correspondences between each tooth in the template and its counterpart in the rigidly aligned dental models. [Specify parameters used in the CPD algorithm, like bandwidth, tolerance, and maximum iterations].\n\n4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** PCA was performed on the aligned point clouds to extract principal components representing the major modes of shape variation for both the entire dentition and individual teeth. The number of principal components retained was determined based on [Specify the criterion used for determining the number of principal components, e.g. variance explained].\n\n5. **Parametric Model Representation:** The principal components and their corresponding eigenvalues define the parametric models. These models can then be used to generate new dental models by linearly combining the principal components.\n\n\nThis extremely detailed methodology section provides a comprehensive overview of the methods used in the study.  Further specifics about software versions, parameter choices, and validation procedures should be added to enhance reproducibility.  Also, consider adding a flowchart summarizing the entire process.\n",
